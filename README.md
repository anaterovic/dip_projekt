The seminar explores the possibilities of using conventions and practices for good design for the purpose of automating the evaluation of user interface designs. Replication of one of the mentioned papers is also included. 

## Paper replication on UI design estimation

Replication of "Towards Enhanced Creativity in Interface Design through Automated Usability Evaluation" by Snehal Dhengre.
The goal of the paper is to create a machine learning model to automate the evaluation of UI design.

Replicated model and testing can be found in projekt.ipynb, </br>
while if you want to perform your own testing you can use testing_model.ipynb.

Model testing guidlines:

1. Download files: </br>
– model_888989.json, </br>
– model_888989.h5, </br>
– testing_model.ipynb. </br>

2. Download all necesary modules noted at the begging of testing_model.ipynb notebook ie. with a command pip install.

3. In testing_model.ipynb notebook substitute IMAGE_PATH variable with the image path of your image you want to test.

4. Run testing_model.ipynb notebook.
